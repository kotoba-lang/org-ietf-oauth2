;; `kotoba/oauth2/callback.kotoba`.
;;
;; Two different things are being tested here, and the file keeps them
;; apart on purpose.
;;
;; **Parity** covers extraction: what `code`, `state`, `error` and
;; `error_description` the callback carried. That has an oracle —
;; `oauth2.core/parse-authorization-response` — and the guest must agree
;; with it.
;;
;; **The decision has no oracle**, because the library does not make it.
;; Measured on this repo at 7729252: nothing in `src/` or `test/` compares
;; `state`. RFC 6749 §10.12 says the client MUST implement CSRF protection
;; and gives `state` as the mechanism; `parse-authorization-response`
;; returns the value and leaves the comparison to whoever calls it. So the
;; tests below assert the decision directly, and say so rather than
;; dressing a new rule up as parity.
;;
;; `.cljc` is not required from the guest (require-graph), and it did not
;; grow a second copy of the decision: a security check implemented twice is
;; a security check that will diverge once (ADR-2608261100).
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; Every one of these passes on a naive implementation that reads the
;; callback in the order the RFC prints it:
;;
;;   * `an-error-response-is-not-a-success-even-when-it-carries-a-code` —
;;     §4.1.2.1. Reading the code first is how a refusal becomes a login;
;;   * `state-is-checked-before-anything-else-is-believed` — an injected
;;     error response with the wrong state must be refused as unbound, not
;;     reported as the authorization server's answer;
;;   * `two-empty-states-are-not-a-match` — the naive
;;     `(= expected received)` passes when both are absent, which is the
;;     shape a client gets when it forgot to send one;
;;   * `a-handler-with-neither-state-nor-pkce-is-refused` — a client that
;;     bound its request to nothing cannot tell its own callback from
;;     someone else's;
;;   * `a-refused-callback-yields-no-code` — the code is a bearer
;;     credential for one exchange; handing it back from a refusal would
;;     make the refusal decorative.
